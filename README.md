MovieSU –Student Movie Community App
Overview

MovieSU is a mobile application designed exclusively for university students to explore, rate and discuss movies with eachother.
The app creates a community where students can:

-Browse popular and recent movies

-Leave ratings and reviews

-Join chat rooms to discuss movies with fellow students

-Discover trending films among their friends

-The app ensures a student exclusive environment by allowing registration only with .edu email addresses.

Motivation and Goal

Movie discussions are a big part of student life, yet most existing platforms are public and crowded.
MovieSU aims to provide a safe, academic-based space for university students to:

-Connect through shared movie interests

-Encourage social interaction within the campus community

-Build a recommendation culture based on peer feedback

Our goal is to build a complete social experience around movie watching — not just ratings.
