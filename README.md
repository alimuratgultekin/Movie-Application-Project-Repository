## Target Audience & Problem
University students often want to discuss and rate movies with peers, but most movie apps (like IMDb or Letterboxd) include everyone worldwide.  
There is no platform limited to students where they can review, discuss, and meet for movie nights.

---

## Main Purpose
Create a secure, student-only movie app that encourages campus social interaction through shared movie interests.

---

## Core Features
- Browse a list of movies  
- View movie details (poster, genre, rating, description)  
- Rate and comment on movies  
- Chat groups that can be used to discuss movies  

---

## Extra Features
- Event planner (organize movie nights)  
- Movie recommendations  
- Trending Section  
- Mood-based Movie Suggestions  
- Movie Soundtrack Finder  
- “Guess the Movie” mini game  

---

## Platform
Flutter  

---

## Data Storage
Firebase (user info, chat messages, ratings, comments, and movie data)  

---

## Unique Selling Point
Only users with verified “.edu” emails can register, making it exclusive to university students and safer for socializing.  

---

## Challenges
- Firebase authentication using edu emails  
- Real-time chat integration  
- Managing database structure for comments and chats  
- Designing a clean, responsive Flutter UI
